## Solution

### Why Terraform

Terraform was chosen to code the infrastructure components. Terraform is a powerful tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure.

In configuration files, Terraform describes the components needed to run an application or your entire datacenter. It then executes the execution plan to reach the desired state. 

Terraform can detect changes in configuration, and create incremental execution plans that can be applied.

### Usecase of Terraform

Terraform has the ability to use both low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc.

Terraform is able to create, modify, and delete resources on infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, as well as PaaS and SaaS services.

With this feature, code can be ported across multiple cloud providers and standardized infrastructure can be built on any cloud.
