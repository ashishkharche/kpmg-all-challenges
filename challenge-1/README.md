## Problem

## Solution

### Why Terraform

Terraform was chosen to code the infrastructure components. Terraform is a powerful tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure.

In configuration files, Terraform describes the components needed to run an application or your entire datacenter. It then executes the execution plan to reach the desired state. 

Terraform can detect changes in configuration, and create incremental execution plans that can be applied.
